            Data visualization focuses on the transformation of predominantly non-visual data sets into 
            visually represented forms of information. It has contributed quite significantly to society and 
            has only been enhanced through computers and software systems – which has allowed for 
            data visualization to be carried out more quickly and represented more accurately. People are 
            now able to manipulate and process data more easily and affordably. Computers have 
            enhanced data visualization through four predominant aspects: real-time interaction, on-the-fly 
            processing, visual scalability and user assistance and personalization.
            </p>

            <p>
            Data can be divided and analyzed through two major sub-fields: information visualization 
            and scientific visualization. Both of which make use of visual data representations to make 
            data sets more understandable and to allow for more insight and knowledge to be processed. 
            Information visualization deals with the processing of abstract data, and can be analyzed and 
            processed through trees, maps, scatter plots, charts, tables, diagrams and graphs – each 
            serving their own purpose and being used for different types of data set representations. 
            Scientific visualizations are usually physically based and represent scientific data. This type 
            of data visualization can be processed through waveforms, simulations and volume – again, 
            each serving their own purpose and representing specific types of data sets.  
            </p>

            <p>
            It is important to note that there is a difference between data and information. Data is 
            considered to be raw, unprocessed sets of information that have no significant meaning of
            their own. Data is more symbolical and has to be processed in a form more understandable 
            and interpretable to us as humans – this form can be identified as information. Information is 
            a collection of data, that is more useful and provides us with necessary answers.  
            </p>

            <p>
            Overall, data visualizations need to be designed efficiently and effectively in order to 
            properly and successfully provide us with meaningful and useful information. Data 
            visualizations should be unbiased and simply communicate factual sets of collected data in a 
            visual form. It should be readable, recognizable and have meaning, which allows for better 
            comprehension of data sets and better knowledge acquisition. Human perception also plays a 
            large and important role in data visualization as it deals with the organization of sensory data. 
            Aesthetics is a factor not accounted for in data visualization, however it too has a significant
            impact on the understanding and insight of information.
