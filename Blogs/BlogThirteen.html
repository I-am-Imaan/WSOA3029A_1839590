                    My Data-Driven Artwork
                </h1>  

           </article>

        <article class = "blog-content">
            <p>
                For my data-drive artwork, I wanted to create something unique that would allow for me to teach people about what it is 
                like being a diabetic, while still capturing their attention and allowing for engagement. I decided to go about this by 
                creating my own version of the classic, and famous, snake game. In my version of the game, the snake acts as a representation
                of a diabetic trying to maintain and manage their blood glucose levels in order to stay alive and healthy.
                I created this game as is it something easy and simple to understand for most - also being something that a lot of people are familiar with.
                Most people almost instantly know what to do and how to play the game. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I have used the colour scheme of my website in my implementation of the game. The snake is grey, while the pieces it needs to collect are in colour
                - making them stand out and attract the user's attention. The pieces that are coloured green represent food, while the pieces coloured
                blue are insulin. Using both these colours allows for distinctions between the two piece types to be made, as well as aids the user in 
                understanding each of their effects on the diabteic snake and its blood glucose levels (mmol). Further understanding is made possible through the provision of 
                the game key, to the right of the game - which details what each piece is and what it does.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I have chosen to create this as my data-driven artwork in order to represent and communicate the difficulties of being a diabetic. 
                Diabteic management is not easy. It is difficult to manage and control, which often leads to erratic blood glucose levels - and eventually critical damage
                to vital organs and body operations (such as sight, mobility, immunity, etc.).

            </p>
            <p> 
                I personally feel as though my data-driven artwork was well communicated and represented. It gets across the message that I intended on communicating to
                users and people in general. However, I do feel as though there is always room for better use of representational and communication strategies. I would have liked
                to have the blood glucose level indicator change colour, depending on whether the levels were well controlled, too low, or too high. This would allow for emphasis to 
                be placed on the blood glucose level monitoring and allow for users to understand the consequences of what they are doing - through the use of colours that have
                pre-determined associations and connations (such as red and green). I also would ahve liked to have incorporated a variety of different pieces that the snake
                can collect - having different foods that affect sugar levels differently and differnt insulin doses accordingly.
