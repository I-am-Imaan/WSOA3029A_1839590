                    'Communicating Data To An Audience'
                </h1>

        <article class = "blog-content">
            <p>When it comes to data and data visualizations, how it is communicated to an audience is crucial to its success in effectively conveying meaning and delivering the intended information. Successful communication of data to an audience requires that the creator of that data/ data visualization, recognizes and caters toward the needs, goals, and knowledge of the intended audience – first and foremost, identifying who that intended audience is, and why. This is important as it allows for the creator to personalize data and enhance it in a way that the audience will respond well to. </p>
            <p>This is easier said than done, however, as an audience is made up of a large number of people – all from different backgrounds, cultures, etc. Meaning that every member of an audience has different needs and expectations when it comes to data representation, making it practically impossible to cater to everyone’s individual needs. This often results in data depictions and representations being quite limited and generalized in their portrayal, which in turn decreases the audience and target audience size. Despite this, however, it is still essential and beneficial to refine data to cater to the large majority of the intended target audience. </p>
            <p>Different audiences and individuals have different levels of familiarity, literacy, and capabilities when it comes to data visualizations. They have different goals, needs, expectations, attention spans, as well as cognitive abilities – all of which need to be carefully understood and considered by a creator throughout their process and creation of a data visualization. The creator needs to focus on catering toward the general trend and large majority of an audience’s desires in terms of data. A number of aspects within data visualizations can be considered and catered to at a universal level. Data should be readable, understandable, and easily interpreted by an audience through the nature of its layout and implementation. The data presented in a data visualization should be accurate and non-misleading to the audience, as a basic ethical practice. The choice, styling, and placement of annotations, typography, colour etc., is beneficial in aiding the interpretation and understanding of a data visualization by an audience. Data visualizations should be informative, relevant and up to date. It is also beneficial to allow for user interaction and involvement within a data visualization, as it allows for the data to be more engaging. </p>
            <p>In order to create a data visualization that is designed to best cater to and communicate with an audience, the creator needs to know their goal and intention in creating and displaying the data. They should also ensure that they are using the right data set relevant to the message they intend to convey, select suitable visualizations that are coherent and easily interpretable, design for aesthetics, choose a good medium on which to display their data to an audience, and thereafter check the results and feedback received on their data visualization – in order to edit and adjust accordingly. </p>
