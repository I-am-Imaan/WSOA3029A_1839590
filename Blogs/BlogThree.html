            <p>
                My aim in designing this website was that of creating a site that has been well-thought out 
                and caters to the enjoyment and satisfaction of the users experience on the site. In an attempt
                to meet this goal, I have considered a number of design factors in terms of the site – from 
                colour scheme and layout, to spacing, etc. I designed my website with a close consideration 
                of points brought up in the “Theories of representation” chapter, by Jenny Kidd. It was of 
                importance to me that I ensured that the signs, images, bodies of text, etc., contained within
                my website, had meaning and enhanced the development and portrayal of the narrative that I
                am intending to create – as every choice made in the design of my website, matters and can 
                either add to or take away from the experience of users on my website.
            </p>

            <p>
                I wanted to create a website that is very simple in appearance, yet still appealing and 
                informative. It is important for the information displayed on my website, to be readable, 
                legible and understandable – this will be done through specific focus on the alignment of text, 
                placement of images and data visualizations, font types and sizes, and so on. I have tried to 
                design my website in a way that there is a lot of repetition in element usage, layouts and 
                interactables, as well as colour schemes and associations. I will have a sticky navigation bar, 
                displayed at the top of each web page that will aid the user in navigating through the content 
                of my website in a quicker, easier and more accessible manner. The layout of blogposts, data 
                visualization content, etc., will also be similarly styled in order to allow users to understand 
                the website better and navigate it more easily. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The information and elements displayed on my website is designed to be well spaced and not 
                overcrowded or overloaded with information – just enough for the user to understand what 
                the content of each element is. The headings on my website are all centered in alignment, 
                whereas the information and textual content will be left aligned. This has been done to ensure 
                that the headings and topics stand out, and catch the user’s attention, as they are short text 
                pieces. The information is left aligned, as it makes it easier to read and understand large 
                bodies of text in this sense – due to the western convention of reading from left to right. My 
                website also contains a number of interactable elements including buttons, clickable posts, 
                scrolling etc. This is done in order to keep the user engaged throughout their use and 
                exploration of my website.  
            </p>

            <p>
                The colour scheme that I have chosen for my website, is mainly that of cool colours (greens, 
                blues, white, grey etc.). This was implemented, as the content and narrative I plan on 
                displaying and telling through my website is something that a lot of people find 
                uncomfortable or uneasy. It is a topic that many aren’t familiar with and often brings a sense
                of morbidity. I want to go against this and want to use these colours as their connotations 
                usually bring a sense of calm and will hopefully make my users feel at ease, as well as more 
                comfortable with learning about the topic of my website.
