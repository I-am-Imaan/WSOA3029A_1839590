                    Interactivity As A Semiotic Device
                </h1>

        <article class = "blog-content">
            <p>Interactivity in data visualizations serve more of a purpose rather than simply just being implemented for the fun of it. Semiotics play a significant role in this interaction and can be used as a means of understanding how and why interaction is beneficial in its implementation within a data visualization. I will be using ‘Are we alone in the universe?’, as a means of analysing the role of interactivity as a semiotic device within data visualizations. ‘Are we alone in the universe?’, is an interactive data visualization that depicts and allows for users to calculate the possibility of extraterrestrial life in the universe. The visualization can be found here: https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/the-drake-equation/. </p>
<p>Before going into an analysis of the data visualization, it is important to understand a few concepts. First and foremost, it is important to understand what exactly constitutes as interactivity. Interactivity online, can be identified as attributes that are physically activated by the user through clicks, touches, drags etc., all of which allow for a consequential change in appearance of the data system or visualization – a reaction. Every interaction has meaningful form, requires action and produces an effect, and every interaction is meant to be analyzed and interpreted by the user. Next, it is important to understand the term ‘semiotics’, which can be understood as the study of signs, symbols etc., as well as the study of how meaning is created through these signs and symbols. Semiotics involves interpretation, which is subject to change based on the user’s personal background and perception of what they are seeing and interpreting. The use of semiotics in interactivity can allow for better conveyance of the message and information contained within a data visualization, as it allows for the enhancement of the portrayal of meaning. </p>
<p>With the understanding of these concepts in mind, ‘Are we alone in the universe?’ can be analyzed in terms of the role of interactivity as a semiotic device. ‘Are we alone in the universe?’ is an interactive visualization that allows for users to calculate the possibility of extraterrestrial life in the universe, using either Drake or Seager’s equations. The user can choose which equation they would like to use through the dropdown menu selection within the visualization. Upon selection, each equation and theory are briefly explained, categories of pre-defined data are made available in relation to each equation, and the visualization itself changes accordingly. The data visualization is made up of a set of equilateral triangles, placed side by side and in an alternating fashion (the first triangle has its point up, while the next is down and so on). Initially, the triangles are all depicted in greyscale, and upon hovering over them, they are shown in different colors – each relating to their type. Hovering also reveals information about the purpose of each term in the equation and how it influences the overall calculated result. Users can calculate using pre-set data values, or they can play around with the figures and provide their own input in order to determine an output. </p>
<p>Semiotically, the colors of the data visualization allow for users to group information together and create links between them subconsciously. Triangles are often perceived to be strong, sharp shapes, which reinforce the believability of the information displayed using them. The use of visual icons and depictions, color, selections, and overall interactivity within ‘Are we alone in the universe?’ allow for a complicated equation to be simplified and made more readable and understandable to users, as well as allows for them to feel more involved and engaged with the information depicted through the data visualization. </p>
