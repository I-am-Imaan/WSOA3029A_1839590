                    UI/UX Analysis Of Superbalist
                </h1>  

           </article>            

        </header>

        <article class = "blog-content">
            <p>
                Superbalist is a South African online shopping website. They sell a wide variety of fashion 
                products, ranging from clothing, shoes, accessories, beauty products, as well as homeware for 
                men, women, and children. Superbalist is a very popular website and is used by many South 
                Africans nationwide. In this blogpost, I will be critically analyzing the homepage of their 
                website in terms of its UI, UX and general design – as well as the various forms of 
                representation presented on and through their homepage. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The Superbalist homepage makes use of and implements quite a few UI elements onto its 
                homepage. The homepage contains interactable buttons that aid in site navigation, dropdown 
                menu’s, search and input fields, as well as various icons. The UI of the homepage is simple 
                and clean, elements are consistent, the page layout has been well thought out and 
                communicated, and the colour and typography used in the homepage design is readable and 
                minimalistic . The Superbalist website uses a colour palette consisting of 
                black, white and greens. There is not an overwhelming amount of colour present on the 
                homepage and the use of green is implemented in order to catch the viewer’s attention and 
                emphasize important aspects of the website (such as sales etc.). The homepage layout is done 
                in such a way that guides the user through pages for clothing specified to their gender and age 
                group.  
            </p>

            <p>
                In terms of representation and the construction of meaning through their selected UI 
                elements, Superbalist makes use of icons such as shopping carts, delivery vehicles etc. These 
                icons have attached meanings that have been constructed in relation to their associations. The 
                shopping cart is associated with the physical cart used in shopping malls, and allows users to 
                make a connection between the similar activities of shopping in person to that of shopping 
                online. Their choice of the order of how categories are presented, also have meaning and 
                implications. The women’s category is always placed before the men’s and is also 
                emphasized more. The dropdown menu for the women’s category also has a significantly 
                larger amount of options, in comparison to the men’s dropdown menu. 
                This suggests the constructed assumption and representation of women enjoying and 
                partaking in shopping more often than men. This speaks to the presentational context of the 
                website and reveals the intentions of Superbalist as a brand.  
            </p>
