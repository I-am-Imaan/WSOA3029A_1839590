                    Analysis Of Information Is Beautiful Visualization
                </h1>  

           </article>

        <article class = "blog-content">
            <p>
                Information Is Beautiful, is a website that depicts a range of data (relevant to the world) through the use of a variety of different data visualizations – from bar graphs, to bubble charts etc. For this particular blogpost, I will be analyzing a data visualization titled “Coronavirus Riskiest Activities” which addresses and informs of different types of activities and how high the risk of contracting the Coronavirus is through partaking in these various activities. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The data visualization is that of a bubble chart, divided up into three different activity categories – low risk, medium risk, and high risk. The different activity names are placed, in text, within each bubble in the visualization. Extra information is added where needed in white text and linked to the relevant bubble. The bubbles contained within the data visualization increase in size from left to right. The colours of the bubbles also become darker and more intense from left to right (starting from light yellow, moving on to orange, and finally ending on red).  
            </p>

            <p>
                Just glancing at this data visualization, I feel very overwhelmed with the amount of text and information provided. The excessive amount of information displayed feels very cluttered and I sometimes find it hard to know where to look within the visualization. This being said, the data visualization does serve its purpose well in being an informative piece – providing warnings, guidelines and general care tips as well. The increase in bubble size, as well as the increase in colour intensity from left to right, is a good aspect utilized within this data visualization. It allows for the viewers eye to be guided well across the visualization and successfully creates the implication of increased risk. The use of warm colours also emphasizes the serious nature of the information contained within this data visualization, due to general colour associations and connotations. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The use of the white dotted line to separate each categorical section, allows for the contents of each category to be grouped well, as well as allows for the viewer to process the information and understand it a bit easier. The use of the information given in blue is a good choice, as the colours are more calming and reassuring – which fits well as the information given in blue is mainly caution and preventative measures that can be taken. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Overall, I think that this data visualization is well represented and communicated. Apart from the excessive amounts of information contained within the visualization, most other aspects have been well-considered and effective in their utilization and portrayal of information.
