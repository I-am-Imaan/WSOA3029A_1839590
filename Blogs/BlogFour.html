                    Analysis Of Historic Visualization

                Data visualizations are an old concept, dating significantly far back in history – however, it 
was not until the 19th century that they became focused on more than just geographical data 
(i.e., maps). There have been a number of contributors to the development of data 
visualizations throughout history, one of which being Charles de Fourcroy – a French 
mathematician and scholar. Fourcroy created a means of visually representing quantitative 
data through what he called, Tableau Poléometrique (as seen below). Through this creation, 
he specifically visually represented the populations and demographics of various European 
cities – in order to offer a comparison between the cities, as well as allow for different forms
of analysis to be conducted using this information.

            <p>
                In this form of data visualization, squares are placed on top of one another in order to display 
                hierarchical sets of quantitative data. Colour has no role, other than to allow for each square 
                to be distinguished from one another. Through Tableau Poléometrique, Charles de Fourcroy
                revolutionized data visualizations through the use of patterns, colours, and shapes – in order 
                to aid in a quicker understanding of the data being represented. Tableau Poléometrique is 
                believed to have resulted in the creation of the modern data visualization form of treemaps.  
            </p>

            <p>
                Treemaps use different sized rectangles in order to represent hierarchically ordered sets of 
quantitative data – similar to that of Charles de Fourcroy’s Tableau Poléometrique. These 
data visualizations (as mentioned) are used mainly to compare various quantities and aim to 
create a visual understanding thereof. It is important to note that they are not intended to be 
highly accurate in their representations of data, but rather just offer a general idea in terms of 
quantity relations.
 
            </p>

            <p>
                For example, the treemap above serves to visually represent the number of different animals 
found within a pet shop – highlighting which animals you would find more or less of. 
Through this data visualization, it can be seen that birds are the larger majority within the pet 
shop, whereas reptiles are the minority. It further divides these categories, and it can be seen 
that there is a significant amount more of Zebra Finches in comparison to Lovebirds, for 
example. Analysis of this data visualization can aid in the identification of popular pets, or 
which animals require different food, etc. Deriving meaning and understanding from this 
treemap is done through the grouping of each category (mainly through colour and size), the 
differences between each category (distinguishing between birds and mammals, for instance), 
as well as through providing context in order to understand the data (being aware that these 
are animals found within a pet shop, and not in general etc.). 
            </p>

            <p>
                From the creation of Tableau Poléometrique to the modern form of treemaps, the shift in data 
visualization forms can be identified and understood – especially seeing as data visualizations 
used to only consist of handwritten/drawn visualizations, whereas now they are 
predominantly digital. Data visualizations have evolved throughout the years and the general 
public have become more data literate. Data visualizations are a huge part of our world today, 
especially that of visual data representations.
