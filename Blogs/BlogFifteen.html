                    Reflecting On My Data-Driven Art
                </h1>

        <article class = "blog-content">
            <p>
                As discussed previously (see Blog Thirteen), I have chosen to create my own version of the classic, and famous, snake game as my data-driven artwork.
                I decided to do this as games can count as a form of art and, in this case, it counts as data-driven art - based on the qualities, mentioned by Viegas and 
                Wattenberg, that consitute something as a data-driven art form. In order for something to be a data-driven artwork, it has to be created using 
                actual data, it should be created with the intent of making art, differ from the usual visualizations of data, and lastly, it should not be centered around 
                beauty and aethetics. In accordance with this, 'The Diabetic Snake' (my version of the snake game), is a data-drive artwork as it is created based on data, is 
                intended to be art, differs from common data visualizations, and is not beauty centric. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Art is usually created to communicate a message in some form or another. It is intended to evoke some sort of emotion within its viewer, and encourage
                a change of perspective for them. The Diabetic Snake quite effectively communicates my intended message that diabetes control and managment is 
                not as easy as it seems. It is intended to depict the frustrations of diabetic management to the user, through their interaction and experience 
                of playing the game - showing them how hard it is to keep consistently good blood glucose levels, and how easy it is for them to be erratic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Within the game, the user has to manuever the diabtic snake around and eat food, while making sure to get enough insulin to keep their blood glucose levels
                under control. The user cannot have too much food, nor insulin, as they have to prevent their blood glucose levels from going too high, or too low. While doing this,
                the user also has to keep an eye on their blood glucose levels, in order to monitor it. As the snake eats more, it increases in size - making it harder to move around 
                and stay alive (as it becomes easier to run into walls and its own tail). This allows for the game to portray the sense of difficulty that comes with high sugar levels.
                As the snake consumes insulin, it decreases in size. This seems like a good thing, but if the snake gets too small it also dies - depicting the equally dangerous 
                experience of sugar levels that are too low in diabteics.
