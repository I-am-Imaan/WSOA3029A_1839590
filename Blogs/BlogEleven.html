                    Artistic Data Visualizations
                </h1>

            <p>Data visualizations are being used more and more, as of late. They provide an effective and efficient means of depicting data in a way that is simplified, more readable, and more engaging to users. They are able to communicate numerical, scientific, and advanced data in a visual form, which broadens the audience that can understand certain sets of data. While these data visualizations have become more prominent over the years, a new use and implementation of data visualizations has surfaced and is becoming a new trend – data art. </p>
<p>Whilst data visualizations are commonly used as a tool to support analytic reasoning and factual, academic data, data art is often used to depict a collection of non-academic data in the form of art. However, the data is still actual data collected. Data art, also known as artistic visualizations, can be defined and understood as visualizations of data created by artists, with the intent of making art. It is not focused on superficial beauty, but rather the depiction and representation of data in an art form. </p>
<p>Artistic visualizations are created with the intention of conveying some sort of meaning and/or emotion to its audience. Like most art, it is aimed at speaking to people on an emotional level and depicts some sort of story or provides information that is thought provoking. Artistic visualizations, again like most art, is often open to interpretation from the viewer – they choose what they see, how they feel, and what they think of a data art piece. Interpretation is often influenced by their personal background, culture, mentality, prior exposure, etc., hence every person will view the same artistic visualization in a different light and from a different perspective – offering a new interpretation of the same data art. </p>
<p>Data art is created with a purpose and is often intended to be persuasive to its audience. It can also reveal certain emotions, thought processes, state of mind, and intents of the artist that created it. The artist of an artistic visualization considers all aspects about a data art piece, throughout its creation. Distortions, depictions, placement, color, etc., has all been carefully considered and implemented by the artist in their artistic visualization, allowing for analysis of the data art to be made possible – as it would be for any other art form. Data art can be analyzed in terms of its atmosphere of appearance, color, arrangement, display, etc.  </p>
<p>Data art is becoming a new and popular trend as a result of the increased availability and capabilities of more user-friendly, artistic software, as well as the increased importance of data in society today. Almost everything can be analyzed and depicted through the use of data, and this has resulted in the increase of different methods and means of depicting and visualizing that data. </p>
