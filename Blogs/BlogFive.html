                    Close Reading On Knaflic 'Chapter 6'

                Data visualizations are a means of being able to communicate and convey specific sets of 
                data and information to a specific target audience. In the process of creating data 
                visualizations, it is important to take into consideration how exactly it is intended for an 
                audience to process and receive the data information (i.e., identifying what information needs 
                to be emphasised, highlighted, elaborated on, etc., in terms of importance). There are several 
                factors that can be taken into account and improved on, in order to create the best possible 
                data visualization – catering for and informing a specific target audience. These factors will 
                be pointed out, analysed, and discussed with regard to Chapter 6 of the Knaflic reading, titled 
                ‘Dissecting model visuals’ – in which Knaflic has provided numerous data visualisations that 
                have been well designed and well catered to their specific target audiences. In these data 
                visualisations, factors such as the use of colour, line thickness, font type and style, text 
                choice, positioning, placement, alignment etc., have all been taken into account and used to 
                enhance the information presented within each data visualisation. These factors will be 
                further discussed and analysed below. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The colour, thickness and styling of certain aspects within data visualizations, play an 
                important role in allowing an audience to be able to identify, read and retain important 
                information provided through the data visualization. Using multiple different colours within a 
                data visualization, will confuse the audience and make it hard to identify what information is 
                important, as well as make it hard to understand the data visualization in the first place. 
                Displaying information, within a data visualization, in different shades of greyscale and using 
                shades of one other colour (e.g., shades of blue) will allow for information in the other colour 
                to be emphasised within the data visualization, thereby highlighting it as important. This 
                emphasis of importance can also be achieved through making a line, bar, text, figure, etc. 
                thicker within a data visualization, or styling it differently in comparison to the rest of the 
                data present within a data visualization (i.e., using dotted lines or different shading etc.).   
            </p>

            <p>
                The text used within a data visualization is also important in communicating information to 
                an audience. Text can be used through the title of a data visualization, labelling of axes and 
                graphs themselves, as well as through annotations provided within data visualizations. All 
                text found and displayed within data visualizations should be chosen and worded 
                appropriately. Only important and crucial information should be displayed, in order to aid the 
                audiences understanding of the information presented. The usage of text should be kept to a 
                minimal, again only highlighting important information. Text should be well considered and 
                placed in a way that does not clutter the data visualization and make it hard to read and 
                understand for the audience. Preferably, text should always be justified or left aligned, as well 
                as horizontally displayed on a data visualization – this makes it easier to read and process the 
                information provided through the text.
                 
            </p>

            <p>
                When using numerical figures within a data visualisation, it is important to carefully consider 
                how these figures are displayed. Figures should be rounded off where possible, not be too 
                long, and if they can be provided to the audience in intervals, they should be. Good data visualizations are designed to be scannable, highlighting important information 
                and making it easily identifiable to an audience. The choice of data visualization type, as well 
                as how all of the above factors are utilized and implemented, is also dependent on the type of 
                audience, as well as personal preference of the designer. However, the use of certain 
                conventions and styles are recommended, in order to cater to a larger target audience, as well 
                as make the data information more universal.
