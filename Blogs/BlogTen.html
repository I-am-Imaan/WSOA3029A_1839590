                    My Interactive Data Visualization

            <p>The implementation of interactivity within data visualizations allows for users to be able to manipulate and explore graphical representations of data. Implementing interaction can be beneficial to the depiction of a data visualization as it enhances the experience and exploration of that data visualization for the user. Interactivity can allow for the user to identify trends in the data faster, identify relationships between data aspects more easily, convey storytelling, simplify complex sets of data, and emphasize certain focal points within the data that the creator wants to highlight or draw attention to. Given this importance of interactivity within data visualizations, and the benefits they result in – for both the user and creator – I will be critically analyzing the interactivity implemented into one of my data visualizations on this website. </p>
            <p>I have chosen to create an interactive tree graph in the depiction of the data I have gathered, showing the relationship between body-fat percentage, body mass index, and diabetes. The tree graph is made up of different nodes that indicate certain aspects of categorized data from the data set – starting with the title of ‘Body-Fat %’ and branching off into high or low body-fat categories and the values that relate to them, then indicating whether the person is considered to be over, under or average weigh in relation to their BMI. The final nodes reveal whether the person is diabetic or not. Using this form of interaction, whereby information is progressively revealed, the user is able to read the data provided and depicted and make their own assumptions of the result to follow. This allows for emphasis to be given to the fact that most people are under the belief that to be overweight means to be diabetic – which the tree graph eventually debunks. </p>
            <p>My tree graph visualization also makes use of color to indicate when a node has branches and when it does not, as the node changes from green to blue when information is revealed through interaction. The use of a tree graph also allows for links to be created and information grouped, as they branch out from one another. The gradual reveal of information also allows for slower intake and processing of the data depicted, by the user. Overall, the implementation of interactivity has enhanced this data visualization, allowing for involvement and inclusion of the audience as well as allowing for better conveyance of my intended message. </p>
