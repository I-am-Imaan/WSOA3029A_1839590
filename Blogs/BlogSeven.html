                    Critical Reflection Of My Graphs
                </h1>

        <article class = "blog-content">
            <p>
                In this blogpost, I will be analyzing the two data visualizations that I intended to create for my website. In accordance with my website narrative of educating people about the chronic illness of diabetes, as well as debunking the various stereotypes commonly associated with the illness – I have decided to create data visualizations that each address and debunk a particular stereotype. The first stereotype being that of people with diabetes always being considered to be overweight (or even have been overweight at some point in their lives). The second stereotype is that of it being assumed that diabetics cannot consume sugar at all, and that sugar is the only thing they need to avoid in order to gain control of their blood glucose levels. 
            </p>

            <p>
                In my depiction of the falseness of the first stereotype, I made use of a bar graph that compares the body-fat percentages of a set of ‘anonymous’ people. These people are known to me and are not actually anonymous, however the disclosure of their names and who they are served no purpose in the data visualization – in fact, in not disclosing their identities, I was able to justify and enforce my point further. The visualization is made up of five vertical bars with the same colour scheme as found in the rest of the website. I wanted to highlight the actual diabetic persons bar in a different colour (still in accordance with the websites colour scheme), when the viewer hovers over it. I also wanted to use different colour shades to indicate which body-fat percentages are considered high, low or good. 
            </p>

            <p>
                In my approach to debunking the second stereotype, I wanted to make a lollipop chart comparing different food types and the affect that they have on the blood glucose levels of a diabetic person. I decided to use a lollipop chart, as it is easier to read and comes across as being more visually clean when there are a lot of categories of comparison. The lollipop chart would be designed in a way that different colours would be used to show and represent when blood glucose levels are at a good range, compared to being too high or too low – also emphasized by the use of dotted separation lines to make the information more clear.   
            </p>

            <p>
                Overall, my data visualizations need a lot of work to get them where I want them to be, in terms of representation and communication.
