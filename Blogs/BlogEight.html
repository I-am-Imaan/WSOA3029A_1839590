                    'What Is Interaction For Data Visualisation'
                </h1>

        <article class = "blog-content">
            <p>The term ‘interactivity’, in relation to data visualizations, is quite challenging to define let alone understand. The term itself suggests some form of active relation between two parties (human or non-human) and is understood in this sense in most of its uses. However, when it comes to interactivity within data visualizations, the term needs a more in depth understanding in order to identify its uses, purpose, as well as how and where it can be implemented and improved. Dimara and Perin aim to provide a proper definition and analysis of interactivity in terms of visualizations in their article ‘What is interaction for data visualization?’, using research conducted and seeking expert opinions on the matter. They have constructed categories, which they have termed tags, that allow for research on interactivity to be divided up and analyzed with specific focus to certain attributes associated with interactivity: definition of interaction, critical on interaction, benefits of interaction, interaction concepts, interactive pipeline, and lists. Through these tags, they aim to formulate a definition of interactivity in relation to data visualizations that accounts for the benefits, as well as disadvantages, of interaction – using concepts that can be applied to interaction, lists, and with relation to the visualization pipeline. </p>
<p>According to Dimara and Perin, interaction has to involve both a user and some form of data – the user being a human being that initiates the interaction, and the data being their main object of interest. What the user uses to interact with, and access data is called a visualization system. It provides the user with a set of controls that allow them to access the data. Interaction can be identified and categorized as a goal-orientated activity and is made up of (or features) action-reaction pairs – where often, the user performs an action using the visualization system and in turn it provides the user with a response or reaction in some form or another. Interaction often involves a process of analysis and research from the user, amplifying their cognition abilities. </p>
<p>However, it has also been identified that interaction can sometimes prove to be problematic and frustrating for the user. Interaction, with relation to data visualizations specifically, can be frustrating as the interaction itself is rarely the focus of the data visualization and is often just added without much thought and planning – often ending up as not flexible enough in the interaction it allows for, as well as being limited in its consideration of the user. Interaction can be designed to cater to a system (system-centric), task (task-centric), or the user (human-centric). The human-centric approach to interaction design and implementation has been identified as the most beneficial, as it is crucial to know who the user is and cater toward them through interaction potential within a data visualization. </p>
<p>After the research and analysis conducted on the interactivity of data visualizations, Dimara and Perin combine their understanding, aided by the information provided to them by experts in the field of interactivity, and are able to provide a better definition of interactivity with relation to data visualizations. They define this as follows: “Interaction for visualization is the interplay between a person and a data interference involving a data-related intent, at least one action from the person and an interface reaction that is perceived as such”. </p>
