                    Meaning through Data Art
                </h1>

        <article class = "blog-content">
            <p>Data art can be understood as being an artistic practice that relies on the usage of a data set to convey emotions and meaning to an audience in an art form. It intends to create an aesthetic form and artistic pieces from digital data sets generated, finding new ways to visualize and interpret the data in ways that are often out of the ordinary. Data art can be analyzed, and meaning identified through them, through a number of aspects, such as: use of color, form, pattern, placement, and so much more. In an attempt to analyze and interpret a data art piece, I will be using Matthias Dittrich’s Narratives 2.0 ( http://www.matthiasdittrich.com/projekte/narratives/visualisation/index.html) to identify artistic strategies used as well as how meaning is created through the data art piece, in its depiction and representation of its specific data set. </p>
<p>Narratives 2.0 is a music visualization, that depicts various musical pieces in the form of an artistic data visualization. It divides the channels found within each piece and depicts them in a fanlike structure, where line angles change according to channel frequencies. Higher frequencies are highlighted in each piece and shown in colour (orange). </p>
<p>Through this artistic data visualization, Matthias Dittrich is able to depict the fluctuation and flow of music in a music piece. The erratic nature of some music pieces is shown through the use of sharper lines that change constantly, whereas some pieces have more rounded lines that easily flow from one to another – indicating their smooth, often calm tone. Lines used in the data art, peak and fall indicating highs and lows within each music piece. The use of colour attracts the viewers eye, allowing for better interpretation and understanding of a music piece, as well as aiding in guidance within the artistic data visualization and allowing for the structure of the piece to indicate the feelings and emotions intended to be invoked through each music piece. </p>
